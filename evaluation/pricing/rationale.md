# Pricing

Precedent: Symex is priced at $20.
Data: In the proxy analyses for Symex vs Qi, programming languages seem to be priced much higher in traditional markets than developer tools.

The reason could be that tools help to create things but aren't essential to them. On the other hand, while one need not use a particular programming language to make something, the chosen language becomes part of the makeup of the finished product and in this way is essential to it.

Another comparison that was considered was across these two categories. If you could only buy either the C programming language, or a full-featured IDE like Visual Studio, which would you choose? Surely, you would choose the former, since you can still achieve your goals with the former and without the latter, but not vice versa. In other words, in isolation, we would pay more for the language than the IDE. On the other hand, we might, by analogous reasoning, pay more for a novel idea in isolation than the labor to implement that idea, as the idea may be considered more precious. Yet, by the 1-N-NÂ² precedent, ideas should be discounted by a scaling factor in order to incentivize the means of implementation. So by this reasoning, the programming language price should be discounted by a similar scaling factor. But the same reasoning would also apply to the tool (IDE) here, so not sure if this line of thinking gets us much closer to an answer.

To synthesize these points, programming languages are _capital_ in projects using them, whereas tools are _instruments_. We don't yet model instruments within the framework of ABE aside from simply paying for them. We might get closer to an answer if we settled on an appropriate scaling factor to use for instruments in comparison with capital and with ideas. At the moment we're not sure what this should be.

## Conclusion

We felt that the price of Qi should be higher than the price of Symex, but not so high as to disincentize investment. We agreed on $30.

# Valuation

Using the same rationale as in Symex, we agreed on $150,000 as being below the cost but not so much below as to be dramatically unfair to initial contributors. And yet, low enough, hopefully, to make investment attractive for new contributors.

# Reservations

We all felt that pricing and valuation is perhaps the most arbitrary component of the DIA process. We don't feel confident that these numbers are the "right" ones, and it will probably become more clear over time what they should be. Some specific concerns that came up:

- Valuation is set much below estimated cost in order for investment to be an attractive proposition for ordinary users. This assumption breaks down if a large organization chooses to invest.
- Typically, people undertake projects in traditional markets with the expectation of profit and not merely compensation for cost, and so the valuation seems low from that perspective as well.
- The price is dramatically lower than most paid programming languages. ABE is quite different from traditional markets on this point, so it is unclear how relevant the traditional values are here, and once again, the price was set to incentivize investment by ordinary users.
