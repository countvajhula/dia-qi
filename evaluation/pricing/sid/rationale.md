# Pricing

Precedent: Symex is priced at $20.
Data: In the proxy analyses for Symex vs Qi, programming languages seem to be priced much higher in traditional markets than developer tools.

The reason could be that tools help to create things but aren't essential to them. On the other hand, while one need not use a particular programming language to make something, the chosen language becomes part of the makeup of the finished product and in this way is essential to it.

Another comparison I considered was across these two categories. If you could only buy either the C programming language, or a full-featured IDE like Visual Studio, which would you choose? Surely, you would choose the former, since you can still achieve your goals with the former and without the latter, but not vice versa. In other words, in isolation, we would pay more for the language than the IDE. On the other hand, we might, by analogous reasoning, pay more for a novel idea in isolation than the labor to implement that idea, as the idea may be considered more precious. Yet, by the 1-N-NÂ² precedent, ideas should be discounted by a scaling factor in order to incentivize the means of implementation. So by this reasoning, the programming language price should be discounted by a similar scaling factor. But the same reasoning would also apply to the tool (IDE) here, so I'm not sure this line of thinking gets us much closer to an answer, and I'm just rambling at this point.

Yet another possible angle is that programming languages are _capital_ in projects using them, whereas tools are _instruments_. We don't yet model instruments within the framework of ABE aside from simply paying for them, so this comparison doesn't really give us much to go on yet, but someday it might.

Synthesizing these last two points, we might get closer to an answer if we settled on an appropriate scaling factor to use for instruments in comparison with capital and with ideas. At the moment I can't quite guess at what this should be.

## Conclusion

Based on a vague synthesis of the above, I felt that the price of Qi should be higher than the price of Symex, but not so high as to disincentize investment. So I settled on $25.

# Valuation

Using the same rationale as in Symex, I chose $150,000 as being below the cost but not so much below as to be dramatically unfair to initial contributors. And yet, low enough, hopefully, to make investment attractive for new contributors.
